 *
 * ## Why the renderer's `Pr` type is not this type
 *
 * `electron/main/**` may not import `src/**`, so main could not produce a `Pr`
 * even if it wanted to. It is also the wrong shape: `Pr.session` names the
 * session that owns a PR, which is an app concern main knows nothing about. The
 * renderer resolves that from a branch match, in a selector — see
 * `usePrs()`. What crosses IPC is what GitHub said, mapped to named fields.
