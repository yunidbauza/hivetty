/**
 * The verbs main exposes for GitHub.
 *
 * Composition, and nothing else. `repos.ts` turns directories into repository
 * names, `client.ts` owns the call, `mapping.ts` owns the payload, and this file
 * owns two decisions: which of them a verb needs, and what happens when the
 * machine is not set up yet.
 *
 * **Every verb answers; none throws.** `gh.ts`'s rule, and the reason
 * `GhResult` exists: a rail that cannot render because GitHub is unreachable
 * tells the user this app is broken, when the truth is that GitHub is
 * unreachable.
 *
 * ## Why `gh` is re-resolved on every read
 *
 * `probeCommand` searches the `PATH` a *session* would search, which is the
 * config's runtime environment and can be edited in the settings pane while the
 * app runs. Resolving once at startup would keep reporting "not installed"
 * after the user fixed exactly the thing the message told them to fix.
