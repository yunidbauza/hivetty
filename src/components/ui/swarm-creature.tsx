/**
 * A small breathing creature, for the surfaces that have nothing else on them.
 *
 * ## Where this is allowed, and at what size
 *
 * Two registers, and the size is what separates them:
 *
 * - **Full-stage surfaces at 72–120 px** — the picker's first run, the dormant
 *   orchestrator, the editor with no file, the settings card. Those own the
 *   whole centre and have nothing to compete with.
 * - **Rails at 44 px** — small enough to read as a mark rather than an
 *   illustration.
 *
 * The header's 40 px brand mark (HIVE-100) was a third, and the only one that
 * was never an empty state; the header went in HIVE-213 and the brand is the
 * Phosphor hexagon now.
 *
 * The rails were text-only when this shipped, on the argument that a decorative
 * empty state in a 320 px column beside a live terminal takes more attention
 * than the thing it is apologising for. That argument is about *size*, not about
 * whether a creature may appear at all: at 44 px the creature occupies less height
 * than the two lines of copy beneath it, and the copy is still what the eye
 * lands on. Anything larger in a rail is the thing the original argument
 * correctly rules out.
 *
 * ## Why a canvas
 *
 * The creatures are the Brood's (HIVE-221): drawn every frame from the theme's
 * own colours, so a light theme or an imported one gets a creature that belongs
 * to it, where the WebP sprites they replaced were painted once in one palette. Each is a pure drawing
 * in `src/lib/swarm/` on its own loop; this component only sizes the canvas to
 * the creature's box and clocks it.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * The canvas animates only while it is on screen and the document is visible
 * (`useCanvasLoop`), so a creature in a hidden pane costs nothing. Under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` it paints the creature's `rest` frame once and
 * schedules no frame at all. The creature is still there and simply holds
 * still.

   * - **Overlord** — the overmind's empty fleet and the settings projects card
   *   at 120px, the projects rail, and the explorer with no session open. It
   *   hovers and watches without acting, which is what those states are.
   * - **Spire** — work, pull requests, the editor with no file, and the settings
   *   skills card at 120px. Things with a lifecycle, caught mid-morph.
   * - **Mutalisk** — agents, and the settings agents card at 120px. The unit
   *   that does the work, holding the air until it is sent.
   * - **Egg** — an empty repository in the explorer: nothing has hatched there
   *   yet. The Hatchery's own SVG egg (`BroodEgg`), cropped to a creature's box.
   * - **Drawn, not cast**: the boot cover picks the overlord, the mutalisk or the
   *   spire once per mount, and the new-session picker picks the egg, the spire,
   *   the overlord or the mutalisk once per opening, at 120px. Neither has a
   *   neighbour in that state for a different creature to clash with.
   *
   * That is every call site; a reviewer should be able to check any one of them
   * against this list and find it here. The hive left the casting when every
   * surface it held moved to one of these four.
   *
   * A surface that picks a different creature than its neighbours in the same
   * state turns the channel back into noise, which is the whole reason this is
   * a fixed prop and not a random draw like the phrase beneath it. The boot
   * cover's and the picker's draws happen at their call sites, not here.
