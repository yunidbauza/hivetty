/**
 * Cloning a repository, as a focused sub-view of Settings (story 102).
 *
 * ## Why this replaces the Projects pane rather than expanding inside it
 *
 * Cloning is a task with a beginning and an end, and it is the one moment in
 * settings where the user may have to answer a question under time pressure —
 * a passphrase prompt on a large repository. Giving the terminal the whole pane
 * and putting nothing beside it is what makes that answerable.
 *
 * It deliberately does **not** put progress in the center stage, which is what
 * the ticket's prose asks for. `resolve-view.ts` puts settings above every
 * other state, and the epic forbids settings changing `activeTab` — so honouring
 * that phrase literally would mean closing settings and switching tabs
 * mid-task. Recorded as a deviation on HIVE-54.
 *
 * ## The terminal is writable, and that is the point
 *
 * `readOnly={false}` is load-bearing rather than a default. `git` asks for
 * credentials and host-key confirmation on its tty; a read-only progress view
 * would fail every private repository, which is most people's repositories.

 * is about to create until after it has created it. Kept deliberately naive: it
