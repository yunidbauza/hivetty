/**
 * Work panel — one card per ticket, with its linked sessions and PRs.
 *
 * Navigation by "what I'm shipping" rather than by repo: the same fleet the
 * projects panel groups by project, grouped by work item instead.
 *
 * ## Where the tickets come from (HIVE-69)
 *
 * This file still does one thing — map over `useTickets()`. Every ticket in that
 * array is a real Jira issue; there is no seeded alternative any more, which is
 * what lets the panel treat "nothing yet" as *loading* rather than as data.
 *
 * What this file did gain is the notice above the list, because four of the five
 * source states have something to say and an empty panel says none of it.
 *
 * ## The flash this fixed
 *
 * The store used to boot with eight seeded tickets and a `fixtures` source, so
 * opening the tab painted sample rows for a frame and then swapped them for the
 * real answer. The seed is gone and `loading` took its place: the panel now
 * shows a skeleton until the read resolves, and never shows an issue it did not
 * get from Jira.
 *
 * ## Refreshed on open, and every minute after (HIVE-81)
 *
 * `list-panel.tsx` swaps panels by unmounting them, so mounting *is* the pane
 * opening — the first read is exactly as prompt as the user looking at it. It
 * used to stop there, on the argument that a Jira issue moves when a human
 * moves it, which is roughly never while the panel is open. The premise is
 * false in the way that matters: other people assign you work, and this app's
 * own sessions file tickets. `useTicketRefresh` keeps it current for as long as
 * the panel stays open, on the same shared-timer poller the PR rows already
 * used.
